== Architecture Overview

== Requirements

We want to have a design that is:

. Ultra high scale - support up to a million compute hosts in a region
. Efficient control messaging - no chatty protocol like neutron OVS agent
. Super fast dataplane provisioning for both small and large VPC
. Small ACA on host - low resource, simple, can be ran on hardware

== Alcor Group Agent

Alcor Group Agent is introduced here to meet the ultra high scale requirement mentioned above. A set of nearby compute node (in networking term, like their TOR switch is connected to adjacent physical switchs) will be grouped together to form an AGA cluster. There could be 1000s machines serviced by one AGA if it meets the performance requirement.

AGA will store both the latest full state and potential delta states for a resource belongs to a particular compute node, together with the corresponding version numbers for our of order detection and handling discuss later. It will track whether a resource has been sent down to ACA or not. Since the database will be shared with multiple instances of AGA, a lock is needed when reading/writing to a resource belongs to a compute host. It is a "small" and localized lock therefore it should not impact performance. 

AGA will serve as configuration cache or passthrough proxy for network configurations. For port/router/gateway, AGA will always pass down the configuration because the scale is bounded. For neighbor and security, a hybrid model will be used based on VPC size. That is to pass down to ACA for small VPC, and don't pass down to ACA for large VPC. 

With the requirement to make ACA small, AGA will introduce new abilities that's critical for deployments:

. Avoid sending duplicate configurations to ACA (e.g. neighbors/security group)
. Configuration cache to avoid sending down configuration immediately
. Out of order configuration detection and handling
. ACA restart handling

== Database Requirements

In order to support the Alcor Group Agent, we have the follow database requirements:

. Persistent - old data should always be there and not flushed
. Distributed - multiple instances of AGA can access it concurrently
. Performance - less than 1 millisecond for needed data (e.g. multiple reads on around 10 tables with 10gig of configuration stored in database)

== ACA Restart Handling

See issue #540, ACA restart handling is described below:

=== Neutron OVS Agent Behavior

Neutron OVS agent inserts a canary table during startup. In its main rpc_loop, it will always check on the ovs status by querying the canary table. ovs_status will be set of OVS_RESTARTED if the canary table is not found. 

To handle the OVS_RESTARTED situation, it will re-setup the bridges (br-int, br-tun, etc) and default flows. It will also reset the dvr if it is enabled. After that, it will rely on a background syncing to get the latest tunnels (for L2 neighbors) and DVR (for L3 neighbors) configurations.

=== Alcor Group Agent Solution

With Alcor Group Agent acting as configuration cache for each compute host. (TBD: LINK) When ACA has detected the dataplane (e.g. OVS) has been restarted, ACA will send GoalStateOperationStatus to AGA with operation_status = RESTARTED. This signals AGA that a partcular ACA needs its help to bring down all the configurations. 

AGA will use existing algorthm to bring down all the configuration for ports/routers/gateways (small or big VPC), and neighbor + security group configuration according to VPC size.
